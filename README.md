# Problem Statement for Dashboard:

The company's management recognizes the need to leverage data-driven strategies to optimize sales performance and enhance customer satisfaction. The goal is to develop a user-friendly and visually appealing pizza sales dashboard .By leveraging data visualization techniques, the dashboard will enable stakeholders to track sales performance, identify popular pizza flavours and toppings, analyse customer preferences and identify opportunities for growth and improvement.

# Problem Statement for SQL query:
As a data analyst, my objective is to verify the accuracy and integrity of the pizza sales dashboard that I have made for the pizza company using SQL queries.  It is crucial to ensure that the data is reliable and trustworthy to support informed decision-making and analysis. However, there are concerns regarding potential data inconsistencies, errors, or discrepancies within the database that may impact the validity of the sales data. I  will import the pizza sales dataset in Microsoft SQL Server and verify the values are correct or not so that the user should only get the correct insights.
